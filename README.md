# Hi, I'm Patricio Ramon

Hello everyone! I am a software engineer with a passion for continuous learning and exploring new technologies. I currently work with **Node ‚ö°**, **Angular üÖ∞Ô∏è**, **Flutter üê¶**, and **Python üêç**. I'm also learning **Go üêπ**, **CI/CD üîÑ**, and **DevOps üöÄ**. I also enjoy working with **Linux üêß**.

## About Me

Driven by the desire to optimize and automate processes, I strive to deliver high-quality work and continually improve my skill set. While my public GitHub repository collection is still growing (as most of my work happens in private repositories at my company), each project reflects my commitment to quality and innovation.
